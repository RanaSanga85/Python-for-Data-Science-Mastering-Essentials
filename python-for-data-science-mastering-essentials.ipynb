Understanding Generators and yield\nGenerators are created using functions with the yield keyword. When called, a generator function returns an iterator but does not start execution immediately.\nThe yield keyword is used to produce a sequence of values, and the function state is saved between calls.\nGenerators are memory-efficient as they produce values on-the-fly, allowing iteration over large datasets without loading everything into memory.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5.

The re module in Python provides support for regular expressions.\n\n**Basic Pattern Matching using Regular Expressions:**\nRegular expressions consist of patterns composed of special characters that define search criteria. Here are some common characters and their meanings:\n\n* '.' (Dot): Matches any character except a newline.\n* '^' (Caret): Anchors the regex at the start of the string.\n* '$' (Dollar): Anchors the regex at the end of the string.\n* '*' (Star): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n* '+' (Plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n* '?' (Question Mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.\n* '[]' (Square Brackets): Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.\n* '|' (Pipe): Acts as an OR operator, matching either the pattern before or after it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
