Description:
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for Python programming fundamentals, covering a wide range of topics essential for both beginners and intermediate learners. The repository is structured into distinct notebooks, each focusing on a key aspect of Python programming, providing detailed explanations, examples, and practical tips.

#Topics Covered:

#1. Variables and Data Types: 
Learn the basics of variable declaration, assignment, and common data types such as int, float, string, and boolean. Explore type conversion techniques for effective programming.

#2. Operators: 
Delve into the world of Python operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Gain a solid understanding of their applications and functionalities.

#3. Control Flow (If Statements, Loops): 
Master conditional statements using if, elif, and else. Explore loop structures, such as for and while, for efficient iteration in your programs.

#4. Functions and Modules: 
Understand the principles of function creation, handling arguments, return values, and variable scope. Discover how to import and utilize modules in Python for modular and reusable code.

Lists and Dictionaries: 
Learn to create and manipulate lists, access elements, and perform list slicing. Explore dictionaries and their key-value pairs for efficient data storage.

#5. Tuples and Sets: 
Explore the immutability of tuples and the uniqueness of sets. Grasp basic operations with tuples and sets for streamlined data handling.

#6. File Handling: 
Dive into file operations, including reading from and writing to files. Understand file modes and how to handle exceptions related to file operations.

#7. Exception Handling: 
Master the art of writing try, except, else, and finally blocks. Catch specific exceptions and learn to raise custom exceptions for effective error handling.

#8. List Comprehensions: C
reate concise lists using list comprehensions, iterating over sequences and applying conditions for elegant and efficient code.

#9. Dictionaries and Sets Operations: 
Perform operations on dictionaries, such as adding, updating, and deleting keys. Explore set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#10. Lambda Functions and Map/Filter/Reduce:
Define anonymous functions using lambda. Utilize map, filter, and reduce for iterable processing, enhancing your code's functionality.

#11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics:
Get introduced to the fundamentals of classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for building modular and extensible code.

#12. Decorators and Generators: 
Learn to create and use decorators for modifying functions. Understand generators and the yield keyword for efficient memory usage.

#13. Regular Expressions: 
Explore basic pattern matching using regular expressions. Utilize the re module for powerful string manipulation and text processing.

#14. Working with Dates and Times: 
Utilize the datetime module for performing date and time operations. Learn about formatting and parsing date/time strings for effective time management in your programs.
