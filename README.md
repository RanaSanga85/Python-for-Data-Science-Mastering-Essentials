**2. Operators:**<br>
Delve into the world of Python operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Gain a solid understanding of their applications and functionalities.

**3. Control Flow (If Statements, Loops):**<br> 
Master conditional statements using if, elif, and else. Explore loop structures, such as for and while, for efficient iteration in your programs.

**4. Functions and Modules:**<br> 
Understand the principles of function creation, handling arguments, return values, and variable scope. Discover how to import and utilize modules in Python for modular and reusable code.

**5. Lists and Dictionaries:**<br> 
Learn to create and manipulate lists, access elements, and perform list slicing. Explore dictionaries and their key-value pairs for efficient data storage.

**6. Tuples and Sets:**<br> 
Explore the immutability of tuples and the uniqueness of sets. Grasp basic operations with tuples and sets for streamlined data handling.

**7. File Handling:**<br>
Dive into file operations, including reading from and writing to files. Understand file modes and how to handle exceptions related to file operations.

**8. Exception Handling:**<br> 
Master the art of writing try, except, else, and finally blocks. Catch specific exceptions and learn to raise custom exceptions for effective error handling.
